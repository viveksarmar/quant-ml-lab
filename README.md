# Quant ML Lab 🤖  
Machine Learning Systems for Signal Discovery, Prediction, and Portfolio Automation  

---

## 🔍 Overview
This repository focuses on the **intersection of quantitative finance and machine learning**, building end-to-end ML pipelines for feature engineering, signal discovery, and model-based portfolio allocation.

It bridges **financial domain expertise** with **applied ML systems engineering** — from data ingestion to model evaluation and alpha signal tracking.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Engineer robust **financial features** and alpha signals  
- Train and evaluate **ML models** for return and volatility forecasting  
- Automate **data-to-signal pipelines** with modular systems design  
- Apply **explainability (SHAP, feature importance)** to quantify model intuition
